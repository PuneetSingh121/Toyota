		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>After over 50 years in Australia, Toyota has grown to be one of Australia's leading automotive companies.</p>
		<p>
In the 2014 calendar year, Toyota was the top selling brand for the twelfth year in a row with a market share of 18.2 per cent.</p>
<p>
Quality isn't just a result. It's part of everything we do at Toyota. Starting with hand-selecting the right people to undertake the sketching of a car, right through to materials, the build and the delivery. And it never stops. Because the only way to ensure that you experience quality every time you sit in a Toyota is to ask ourselves, "how can we make this even better?"</p>
<p>
At Toyota we ensure that we don't just meet the world's strictest safety standards, we exceed them. You'll find a formidable package of world-class active and passive safety features on board every one of our cars, but our safe thinking started a long time ago. It's so deeply embedded into Toyota culture that it's central to the everyday thinking of all employees too. You wouldn't expect any less when it comes to the safety of you and your family, so neither do we. We're proud to be overprotective.</p>
